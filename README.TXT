PROLAND LIBRARIES

This directory contains the Proland core library, several "plugins" for
this library, and demos using this library and plugins. Each directory
has its own licence, source tree, examples, documentation and project 
files. The directories are mostly independent, except for some 
dependencies between plugins (and between all the plugins and the core
library).
